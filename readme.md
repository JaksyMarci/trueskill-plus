# Trueskill-plus
## Thesis project based on the Trueskill 2 paper published by Microsoft, with some extra features like having a web UI interface, and metrics of the performances of each rating system.

Note: The project is still a bit of a mess - many files are not needed, or shouldn't be versioned in the first place. However, they were more convenient for me to store here while working on the paper.
Also, this is **not** a Trueskill 2 implementation - it just builds upon the original TrueSkill, and expands it with some of the ideas presented by the TrueSkill 2 paper, using my own interpretation.
